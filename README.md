# LightsOut
LightsOut will generate an obfuscated DLL that will disable AMSI &amp; ETW while trying to evade AV. This is done by randomizing all WinAPI functions used, xor encoding strings, and utilizing basic sandbox checks. Mingw-w64 is used to compile the obfuscated C code into a DLL that can be loaded into any process where AMSI or ETW are present (i.e. PowerShell).

LightsOut is designed to work on Linux systems with `python3` and `mingw-w64` installed. No other dependencies are required.

Features currently include:
* XOR encoding for strings
* WinAPI function name randomization
* Multiple sandbox check options
* Hardware breakpoint bypass option

```

**Intended Use/Opsec Considerations**

This tool was designed to be used on pentests, primarily to execute malicious powershell scripts without getting *blocked* by AV/EDR. Because of this, the tool is very barebones and a lot can be added to improve opsec. Do not expect this tool to completely evade detection by EDR.

**Usage Examples**

You can transfer the output DLL to your target system and load it into powershell various ways. For example, it can be done via P/Invoke with LoadLibrary:

Or even easier, copy powershell to an arbitrary location and side load the DLL!
